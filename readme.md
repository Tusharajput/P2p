# Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Transfer Web Application

This web application allows seamless file sharing between devices using a peer-to-peer (P2P) connection. Users can transfer files directly without a central server, using **PeerJS** to establish connections, and QR codes for simple Peer ID sharing.

## Key Features

- **Direct P2P File Sharing:** Send and receive files between peers in real-time without any intermediaries.
- **Automatic File Transfer:** Once a file is selected, it is instantly sent to the connected peer.
- **QR Code Integration:** Generate a QR code containing your Peer ID for easy sharing.
- **QR Code Scanning:** Quickly connect to peers by scanning QR codes on mobile or tablet devices.
- **Connection Status Display:** Real-time status updates for connection and file transfers.
- **File Previews:** View received and sent files before downloading.

## Technologies

- **HTML5**: Structuring the application's layout.
- **CSS3**: Styling the application interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Enabling P2P connection logic and interactive functionality.
- **PeerJS**: Managing peer-to-peer connections.
- **qrcode.react**: Generating QR codes for Peer IDs.
- **HTML5 QR Code Scanner**: Scanning QR codes to establish peer connections.

## How It Works

1. **Peer ID Generation**: 
   - When you open the application, it generates a unique Peer ID for you.
   - You can share this ID manually or via a QR code.

2. **Connecting to a Peer**:
   - Input the other peer's ID or scan their QR code to establish a connection.
   - Once connected, the file transfer section becomes active.

3. **File Transfer**:
   - Select a file to send, and the app automatically transfers it to the connected peer.
   - The receiving peer can download and preview the file once received.

4. **QR Code Scanning**:
   - On mobile or tablet devices, you can scan the QR code of the peer for easy connection.
